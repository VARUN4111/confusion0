                <h2>Our History</h2>
                <p>Started in 2019, Restaurant Tasty Fusion quickly established itself as a culinary icon par excellence in Yamuna Nagar. With its unique brand of world fusion cuisine that can be found nowhere else, it enjoys patronage from the A-list clientele in Yamuna Nagar.  Featuring four of the best three-star Indian chefs in the world, you never know what will arrive on your plate the next time you visit us.</p>
                <p>The restaurant traces its humble beginnings to <em>The Frying Pan</em>, a successful chain started by our CEO, Mr. Varun Antwal, that featured for the first time the world's best cuisines in a pan.</p>

                    <p>Our CEO, Varun, credits his hardworking local and interstate workers with the intention of giving their children the best future. His mother's wizardy in the kitchen whipping up the tastiest dishes with whatever is available inexpensively at the supermarket, was his first inspiration to create the fusion cuisines for which <em>The Frying Pan</em> became well known. He brings his zeal for fusion cuisines to this restaurant, pioneering cross-cultural culinary connections.</p>

                    <p>Our CFO, Vikas, as he is affectionately referred to by his colleagues, comes from a long established family tradition in farming and produce. His experiences growing up on a farm in the Uttar Pradesh outback gave him great appreciation for varieties of food sources. As he puts it in his own words, <em>Everything that runs, wins, and everything that stays, pays!</em></p>

                    <p>Blessed with the most discerning gustatory sense, Agumbe, our CTO, personally ensures that every dish that we serve meets her exacting tastes. Our chefs dread the tongue lashing that ensues if their dish does not meet her exacting standards. She lives by her motto, <em>You click only if you survive my lick.</em></p>
